# PyTweet

## Purpose
An exercise to learn Python by creating a script that allows me to:
- Capture user input to send out a tweet on the bot: https://twitter.com/pythonbot01
- Have an editable list that can be interacted with:
  - Remove or add phrases
  - Pick a phrase from the list to tweet
- Create a menu system to navigate between the above functionality

## Important info
The API keys.py file is omitted from the repo
This is work in progress project that I plan to revisit soon.
Commit information is missing as I have moved this project to its own repo from my mega repo.
